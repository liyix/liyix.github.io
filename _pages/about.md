Hey there! I am Yixuan, a second-year graduate student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/main.htm), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), advisored by Prof. [Wanyuan Wang](https://wanyuanwang.github.io/). My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, Operation Research and Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degrees in [Computer Science](https://cs.njupt.edu.cn/) from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) in 2022, fortunately working with Dr. [Kang Xu](https://xk57238890.github.io/).

**Factor Graph Neural Network Meets Max-Sum: A Real-Time Route Planning Algorithm for Massive-Scale Trips.** [üìÑ](https://liyix.github.io/images/aamas24.pdf)

**Yixuan Li**, Wanyuan Wang*, Weiyi Xu, Yanchen Deng, Weiwei Wu.

[Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS‚Äô24).](https://www.aamas2024-conference.auckland.ac.nz/)

- For the global path planning problem, designed a novel modeling approach: the Path-Query Factor Graph;
- leveraged the properties of the problem to propose a hybrid pruning technique for the Max-Sum algorithm;
- developed an end-to-end, real-time response framework based on the factor graph neural networks
