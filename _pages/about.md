Hey there! I am Yixuan, a second-year graduate student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/main.htm), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), advisored by Prof. [Wanyuan Wang](https://wanyuanwang.github.io/). My research interest lies in Reinforcement Learning, Operation Research and Multi-Agent Systems. Previously, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degrees in [Computer Science](https://cs.njupt.edu.cn/) from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) in 2022, fortunately working with Dr. [Kang Xu](https://xk57238890.github.io/). Contact me through [yixuanli@seu.edu.cn](mailto:yixuanli@seu.edu.cn).
