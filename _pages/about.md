Hey there! I am Yixuan, a second-year graduate student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/main.htm), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), advisored by Prof. [Wanyuan Wang](https://wanyuanwang.github.io/). My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning, Operation Research and Multi-Agent Systems. My research outputs now include 5 publications accepted, 2 pending submissions, and one granted patent. Previously, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degrees in [Computer Science](https://cs.njupt.edu.cn/) from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) in 2022, fortunately working with Dr. [Kang Xu](https://xk57238890.github.io/). Here is my [CV](https://liyix.github.io/images/Yixuan_Li_CV.pdf) and the [chinese version](https://liyix.github.io/images/Chinese%20Version.pdf). Contact me through [yixuanli@seu.edu.cn](mailto:yixuanli@seu.edu.cn).
